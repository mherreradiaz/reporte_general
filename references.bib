   abstract = {In the semiarid zones of the Mediterranean area, such as the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, as in many others in the world, water scarcity and the increase of water use in many socio-economical sectors, suppose an urgent need to improve irrigation management. To assess the feasibility of using maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) of the tree trunk as a plant water stress indicator for irrigation scheduling in cherry trees (Prunus avium), an experiment was carried out in 2009 under greenhouse conditions where the relationship of MDS with several environmental and physiological variables was studied. Two years-old cherry trees planted in plastic pots were submitted to several irrigation withholding cycles. Fully irrigated and stressed trees presented differences in all measured physiological variables: leaf stomatal conductance (gs), midday leaf water potential (Ψmd), and daily sap flow (Qd), as expected; and also in MDS which, among the variables measured in the plant, correlated best with Ψmd (r2=0.49***). Also a strong (r2=0.65***), two phase relationship was found between MDS and substrate matric potential (Ψs) with a linear response of MDS with some scattering till Ψs reached about -33kPa, followed by a stationary phase with a MDS value about 0.30mm, a potential threshold for irrigation scheduling of young cherry trees. This value corresponded to Ψmd of -2.3MPa and gs of 50mmolm-2s-1, indicative of water stress. Finally, MDS (which can be considered an adequate indicator of cherry tree water status given its strong relation with other indicators of plant water status) was the most sensitive and early indicator of water stress (highest signal to noise ratio) of the measured physiological variables. This high sensitivity makes it a potential candidate indicator for irrigation scheduling in young cherry trees, if the threshold obtained in this work can be validated or any other can be established. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The agronomic response of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) ‘Prime Giant’ to a 4 year-long experiment involving deficit irrigation strategies in a Mediterranean climate was studied in a commercial orchard located in the southeast of Spain (Jumilla, Spain). Four drip irrigation treatments were imposed: (i) control treatment (CTL), irrigated without restrictions at 110% of seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc); (ii) sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) treatment irrigated at 85% ETc during pre-harvest and post-harvest periods and at 100% ETc during floral differentiation; (iii) regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) treatment irrigated at 100% ETc during pre-harvest and floral differentiation and at 55% ETc during post-harvest, and (iv) farmer treatment (FRM), irrigated according to the farmer's normal practice. The crop's response to the different irrigation treatments was analyzed in relation to tree water status. Soil water deficit reduced tree midday stem water potential (Ψ stem ), stomatal conductance (gs) and net photosynthesis (Pn). Branch maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) responded rapidly to irrigation changes during pre-harvest and post-harvest. The lowest Ψ stem values were reached by SDI during pre-harvest and by RDI and FRM during post-harvest. RDI did not lead to Ψ stem water potentials falling to below the threshold of −1.6 MPa in any season, although, FRM caused, Ψ stem to fall below −1.8 MPa in 2017. RDI reduced vegetative growth and did not cause significant lower yields or fruit quality. However, with SDI there was a trend towards smaller fruits and a slightly higher soluble solid content. Post-harvest deficit irrigation increased water productivity without penalizing fruit yield or the quality parameters studied, and allowed water savings of 39% compared to CTL at a time when other fruit tree species require more water. Moreover, RDI and SDI led to significantly less cracking incidence and a lower cracking index, which could extend fruit shelf life.},

   abstract = {Seasonal changes in the relationship between stomatal responses and water potential components in detached leaves of sweet cherry (Prunus avium L. cv. Bigarreau Morreau) and plum (Prunus domestica L. cv. Queen Victoria) were examined by the simultaneous measurement of stomatal conductance and water relation parameters derived from pressure‐volume curves. The water potential threshold for stomatal closure in sweet cherry leaves throughout the season and in plum leaves until mid‐July varied nearly in parallel with changes in the osmotic potential at the turgor loss point. From August onward, closing reactions of plum stomata had no relationship to the turgor loss point. Stomata of sweet cherry leaves opened more widely and showed slower reactions to dehydration early in the season than later. Seasonal changes of stomatal conductance and stomatal responses to dehydration in both species seem thus to be influenced by fruit development and ripening. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

This research assessed the water status of 'Regina' cherry trees using machine learning (ML) modeling from data extracted automatically using infrared thermal imagery (IRTI). These models were used to predict stomatal conductance (gs) and stem water potential (Ψs) (Model 1) and a complete assessment using a matrix differential analysis procedure per IRTI of cherry tree canopies' temperature and relative humidity (Model 2). Results showed that the supervised ML regression models presented high and significant correlation coefficients (R = 0.83 and R = 0.81, respectively) without signs of overfitting assessed through their performance. The complex interactions among climatic factors, the soil moisture, and canopy architecture observed in cherry trees or any other fruit tree oblige exploring the performance of ML-based models to offer simple alternatives for decision-making processes in the field.},

   abstract = {The frequency and severity of drought are expected to increase due to climate change; therefore, selection of tree species for afforestation should consider drought resistance of the species for maximum survival and conservation of natural habitats. In this study, three soil moisture regimes: control (100% precipitation), mild drought (40% reduction in precipitation), and severe drought (80% reduction in precipitation) were applied to six gymnosperm and five angiosperm species for two consecutive years. We quantified the drought resistance index based on the root collar diameter and assessed the correlation between species drought resistance and other morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits by regression analysis. The prolonged drought stress altered the morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits, but the responses were species-specific. The species with high drought resistance had high leaf mass per area (LMA), photosynthetic rate (Pn), and midday leaf water potential (ΨMD), and low carbon isotopic discrimination (δ13C), flavonoid and polyphenol content, superoxide dismutase and DPPH radical scavenging activity. The highly drought-resistant species had a relatively less decrease in leaf size, Pn, and predawn leaf water potential (ΨPD), and less increase in δ13C, abscisic acid and sucrose content, and LMA compared to the control. The interannual variation in drought resistance (∆Rd) was positively correlated with the species hydroscopic slope (isohydric and anisohydric). Korean pine was highly resistant, sawtooth oak, hinoki cypress, East Asian white birch, East Asian ash, and mono maple were highly susceptible, and Korean red pine, Japanese larch, Sargent cherry, needle fir, and black pine were moderate in drought resistance under long-term drought. These findings will help species selection for afforestation programs and establishment of sustainable forests, especially of drought-tolerant species, under increased frequency and intensity of spring and summer droughts.},

   abstract = {A two-year experiment with sweet cherry (P. avium L. cv Prime Giant) trees was carried out to ascertain which of the following commonly used soil and plant water indicators is most effective for deficit irrigation scheduling: Ψstem (midday stem water potential), MDS (maximum daily branch shrinkage), gs (stomatal conductance), θv (soil volumetric water content), Ψm (soil matric potential). For this, soil and plant water relations, as well as the physiological and agricultural responses of trees to three different irrigation treatments, were evaluated. The irrigation treatments imposed were: i) a control treatment (CTL) irrigated at 110% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) throughout the growing season, ii) a regulated deficit irrigation treatment (RDI), which met 100% ETc at preharvest and during floral differentiation and 55% ETc during the postharvest period and iii) a treatment based on normal farming practices (FRM). MDS was the first indicator to detect water stress, while Ψm showed the highest sensitivity postharvest, when it was closely related with Ψstem. Consequently, a multiple linear regression equation based on average Ψm at a depth of 25 and 50 cm, and mean daily air vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was established to estimate Ψstem. The estimated Ψstem explained 84% of the variance in the measured Ψstem. Hence, the equation proposed can be used as a tool to estimate Ψstem and for irrigation scheduling. Based on the relation MDS vs. Ψstem and the observed agronomic response, a postharvest threshold value of −1.3 MPa is proposed for deficit irrigation management in ‘Prime Giant’ cherry trees.},

   abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic analysis has become an important tool in basic and applied research on plant physiology and agronomy. While early systems recorded the integrated kinetics of a selected spot or plant, later systems enabled imaging of at least the slower parts of the kinetics (20-ms time resolution). For faster events, such as the rise from the basic dark-adapted fluorescence yield to the maximum (OJIP transient), or the fluorescence yield decrease during reoxidation of plastoquinone A after a saturating flash, integrative systems are used because of limiting speed of the available imaging systems. In our new macroscopic and microscopic systems, the OJIP or plastoquinone A reoxidation fluorescence transients are directly imaged using an ultrafast camera. The advantage of such systems compared to nonimaging measurements is the analysis of heterogeneity of measured parameters, for example between the photosynthetic tissue near the veins and the tissue further away from the veins. Further, in contrast to the pump-and-probe measurement, direct imaging allows for measuring the transition of the plant from the dark-acclimated to a light-acclimated state via a quenching analysis protocol in which every supersaturating flash is coupled to a measurement of the fast fluorescence rise. We show that pump-and-probe measurement of OJIP is prone to artifacts, which are eliminated with the direct measurement. The examples of applications shown here, zinc deficiency and cadmium toxicity, demonstrate that this novel imaging platform can be used for detection and analysis of a range of alterations of the electron flow around PSII.},

   abstract = {We examined, over the postharvest seasons of 2005-2007, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) for its potential of saving water and maintaining fruit yield and quality in 'Summit' sweet cherry. The postharvest irrigation treatments were: full irrigation (Control), receiving 80% of water in Control (RDI-80%), and receiving 50% of water in Control (RDI-50%). Midday stem water potential (Ψstem) was used for assessing plant water status. In 2006, trees produced a large crop and commercial fruit thinning had to be applied, whereas 2007 was a low crop year. The RDI treatment, first applied in 2005, reduced fruit set in 2006 and also reduced root winter starch concentration. In 2006, fruit set was lower in RDI-50% than in Control. But fruit thinning had still to be done with the final yield being the same among treatments. In 2007, RDI-50% produced more fruit and higher yields than Control. Relationship between postharvest Ψstem and crop load in the following season varied according to the year. They were negatively correlated in 2006 and positively correlated in 2007. Fruit firmness did not vary with irrigation treatments in any of the years. Fruit soluble solid concentration (SSC) and fruit relative dry matter (RDM) for RDI-50% was the highest in 2006 when RDI-50% trees had the lowest fruit set. In 2007, SSC and RDM for RDI-50% were the lowest with the trees having the highest fruit set and crop load at harvest. This study indicates that RDI-50% firstly applied in an "off" year, after crop has been harvested, can maintain fruit yield at similar levels to fully irrigated trees while saving water by 45%. Correction of biennial bearing and partial saving of thinning costs are additional advantages of this treatment. © Springer-Verlag 2009.},

   abstract = {The relative sensitivity of plant- and soil-based measures of water availability were compared for prune trees subjected to a range of irrigation regimes under field conditions. Over the growing season, leaf- and stem-water potentials (ψ) measured at midday exhibited clear differences between frequently irrigated trees and unirrigated trees that were growing on stored soil moisture. Stem ψ was less variable than leaf ψ, and the daily variability in stem ψ was closely related to daily variability in evaporative demands, as measured by vapor pressure deficit (VPD). As a result of lower variability, stem ψ reflected the small stress effect of a moderate, 50% soil moisture depletion irrigation interval, whereas leaf ψ did not. The relation between soil water content and estimated orchard evapotranspiration (ET) was influenced by local differences in soil texture within the experimental plot. The relation between stem ψ and ET, however, was not influenced by soil texture and, in addition, was very similar to the relation between stem ψ and leaf stomatal conductance. Both relationships indicated that a 50% reduction in leaf and canopy level water loss characteristics was associated with relatively small reductions (0.5 to 0.6 MPa) in stem ψ. Stem ψ appears to be a sensitive and reliable plant-based measure of water stress in prune and maybe a useful tool for experimental work and irrigation scheduling.},

   abstract = {The shelf-life of sweet cherries is limited, even if fruit are stored under optimal conditions. Since peduncle discolouration and dehydration may indicate initial quality changes, subjectively graded changes in peduncle appearance are often used to evaluate the decline in fruit freshness. The aim of the present investigation was to objectively determine the properties of fruit peduncles and their applicability as indictors of fruit freshness. Changes in colour and structure (shrinkage, bending, etc.) of fruit peduncles, initially green, turgid and metabolically fully active at harvest, mainly result from variations in water status. Selected components of water status and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were determined to objectively characterize cherry fruit peduncle properties under various postharvest storage conditions. Due to their low resistance to vapour transfer cherry fruit peduncles had much higher water and CO2 losses than fruit bodies. During the initial postharvest phase they significantly (35-45%) contributed to fruit water losses. Although there was a pronounced water transfer from the bodies into the peduncles this could only initially buffer the rapid decline in peduncle water content, which in turn, resulted in decreased vapour transfer conductance, and respiration and photosynthetic activity. The decline in the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), which also indirectly indicated chlorophyll degradation, was mainly due to water losses. Other temperature-dependent metabolic processes such as peduncle senescence affected these variations to a much lesser degree. The results show that changes in peduncle properties are acceptable indicators of losses of freshness in sweet cherries. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Sustainable irrigation strategies in semi-arid regions will support agricultural resilience to climatic change.

The following irrigation treatments were applied; (i) a control of full irrigation, irrigated according to conventional growers’ practice at each orchard, (ii) PDI-30: 27%–33% reduction in irrigation volume, after harvest (67%–73% of control), and (iii) PDI-50: 47%–52% reduction in irrigation volume, after harvest (48–53% of control). Spring phenology (the timing of flower bud development, from side green to full bloom), flower bud moisture content and cold hardiness, and fruit yield and quality (before and after cold storage and shelf-life conditions) were assessed to determine if PDI altered fruit development over the subsequent growing season. Neither PDI-30 nor PDI-50 caused changes in the timing of flower bud phenology, cold hardiness or moisture content relative to the control. PDI treatments also had no effect on fruit yield or fruit quality at harvest or after storage and shelf-life conditions. These results suggest PDI could be used to reduce irrigation water use in semi-arid regions, like the Okanagan Valley, without affecting sweet cherry production or fruit quality.},

For this purpose, the young trees were subjected to two drought cycles with different water stress intensities followed by a recovery period. Three irrigation treatments were applied: control treatment (CTL) irrigated to ensure non-limiting soil water conditions; moderate water stress (MS) subjected to two drying cycles whose duration was dependent on the time elapsed until the trees reached values of midday stem water potential (Ψstem) of −1.3 and −1.7 MPa for the first and second cycle, respectively; and severe water stress (SS) similar to MS, but with reference values of −1.6 and −2.5 MPa. In-between drought cycles, MS and SS trees were irrigated daily as the CTL trees until reaching Ψstem values similar to those of CTL trees. The MS and SS trees showed an important stomatal regulation and lower vegetative growth. The decreasing leaf turgor potential (Ψturgor ) during the drought periods accounted for 40–100% of the reduction in leaf water potential at midday (Ψmd). The minimum osmotic potential for mature leaves was about 0.35 MPa lower than in well-irrigated trees. The occasional osmotic adjustment observed in MS and SS trees was not sufficient to maintain Ψturgor values similar to the CTL trees or to increase the specific leaf weight (SLW). The leaf insertion angle increased as the water stress level increased. Severe water stress (Ψstem < −2.0 MPa) resulted in clear early defoliation as a further step in water conservation.},

However, all farmers in the four regions investigated, Central and Southern Chile and Northern and Central Tunisia, have experienced some type of climate-related crop damage between 2009 and 2018. Temperature-related crop impacts were noticeable in all regions. The main climate-related problems, specifically mentioned by the farmers, were hotter summers, shifts in the amount and patterns of precipitation as well as extreme and unpredictable weather events (such as frosts and hail). Water scarcity (droughts, access to water) is mentioned by the majority of the farmers in all geographical areas as the main current and future climate-related problem they face. Many of the climate change-related problems are region-specific, such as killer frosts in Central Chile and wind and hail damage in Central Tunisia. Adaptive measures will need to take regional differences into consideration. Eighty-three percent of farmers in Chile while only 70% of farmers in Tunisia plan to undertake adaptive measures to reduce climate impacts on their farming operations.},

The irrigation treatments evaluated were: (i) a control treatment (CTL) irrigated at 110% of crop evapotranspiration (ET cd ) to maintain non-limiting soil water conditions, (ii) RDM a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a mild water stress during preharvest (90% of ET cd .) and a medium stress during postharvest (65% of ET cd ) and (iii) RDS a regulated deficit irrigation treatment which applied a severe water stress (55% of ET cd .) during postharvest. There were significant differences during postharvest in soil and plant water indicators such as soil matric potential, midday stem water potential and maximum daily branch shrinkage between CTL and regulated deficit irrigation treatments (RD). However, only midday stem water potential was able to distinguish between RDM and CTL during preharvest. Fruit quality parameters such as fruit size, color, soluble solids concentration (SSC) were periodically measured during fruit developing as well as fruit water potential and osmotic fruit water potential. In 2016, there were no differences in any parameter between treatments. However in 2017 both deficit treatments led to fruits with a higher SSC and darker color than CTL. There were no differences in fruit yield or number of fruits per tree among treatments in either year of the study. When fruit quality was assessed in 2016, the color of the pedicels of fruits from the deficit irrigation treatments were greener than those from CTL after 20 days of cold storage at 2 °C and 90% relative humidity (RH) but and after 5 days of shelf-life simulation (15 °C and 65% RH) the differences between treatments disappeared.},

Three irrigation treatments were assayed: (i) control treatment, irrigated without restrictions at 110% of seasonal crop evapotranspiration; (ii) sustained deficit irrigation treatment, irrigated at 85% ETc during pre-harvest and post-harvest periods, and at 100% ETc during floral differentiation, and (iii) regulated deficit irrigation treatment, irrigated at 100% ETc during pre-harvest and floral differentiation and at 55% ETc during post-harvest. The duration and intensity of the phenological phases of sweet cherry trees, including cold accumulation, flowering, fruit set or fruit and vegetative growth, were assessed to ascertain whether the different irrigation strategies imposed affect the trees' reproductive response (fruit yield, fruit size, leaf area, fruit physiological disturbances, and starch and soluble carbohydrates stock) in the same season or have a negative effect in the next season. Deficit irrigation did not advance, enhance or penalize flowering, fruit set or fruit growth. Neither did it diminish carbohydrate concentration in roots or cause an increase in the number of double fruits, which was more linked to high temperatures after harvest. However, deficit irrigation decreased vegetative growth and consequently the leaf area/fruit ratio, which, when it fell below 180 cm2 fruit-1, affected cherry size.},

   abstract = {Central Chile, home to more than 10 million inhabitants, has experienced an uninterrupted sequence of dry years since 2010 with mean rainfall deficits of 20–40%. The so-called Mega Drought (MD) is the longest event on record and with few analogues in the last millennia. It encompasses a broad area, with detrimental effects on water availability, vegetation and forest fires that have scaled into social and economical impacts. Observations and reanalysis data reveal that the exceptional length of the MD results from the prevalence of a circulation dipole-hindering the passage of extratropical storms over central Chile—characterized by deep tropospheric anticyclonic anomalies over the subtropical Pacific and cyclonic anomalies over the Amundsen–Bellingshausen Sea. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a major modulator of such dipole, but the MD has occurred mostly under ENSO-neutral conditions, except for the winters of 2010 (La Niña) and 2015 (strong El Niño). Climate model simulations driven both with historical forcing (natural and anthropogenic) and observed global SST replicate the south Pacific dipole and capture part of the rainfall anomalies. Idealized numerical experiments suggest that most of the atmospheric anomalies emanate from the subtropical southwest Pacific, a region that has experienced a marked surface warming over the last decade. Such warming may excite atmospheric Rossby waves whose propagation intensifies the circulation pattern leading to dry conditions in central Chile. On the other hand, anthropogenic forcing (greenhouse gases concentration increase and stratospheric ozone depletion) and the associated positive trend of the Southern Annular Mode also contribute to the strength of the south Pacific dipole and hence to the intensity and longevity of the MD. Given the concomitance of the seemingly natural (ocean sourced) and anthropogenic forcing, we anticipate only a partial recovery of central Chile precipitation in the decades to come.},

The Metropolitan region of Chile is a relevant producer of high-value crops and is prone to droughts. Standardized Drought Indices were used to characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts for the period from 1985 to 2015. To understand the relationship between droughts and water quality, we evaluated the correlations between daily discharge and surface water quality observations. The threshold level method was used to compare physicochemical parameters during hydrological drought periods with the Chilean water quality thresholds for agricultural uses. A significant (p < 0.05) negative relationship between discharge and electrical conductivity and major ions was found in most of the basin. Hydrological stations located in irrigation districts exceeded the official thresholds for these parameters during hydrological drought periods seriously threatening irrigated agriculture of the region.},

Southern Chile has been affected by climate variability, particularly relating to the quantity, distribution, and frequency of rainfall patterns. Over time, this has changed the red clover persistence and dry matter (DM) yield. The study was conducted at the Regional Research Center Carillanca of the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (INIA-Carillanca), Región de La Araucanía, Chile (38°41′ S, 72°25′ W, and its elevation is 188 m.a.s.l.) during the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 growing seasons. The objective was to evaluate the response of red clover materials on dry matter yield, populations, and irrigation water use efficiency under deficit irrigation (DI) conditions. The irrigation treatments were: non-stressed (T1; irrigation application was supplied when the volumetric soil moisture content was close to 50% of total water available), 80% of T1 (T2), 60% of T1 (T3) and rainfed (T4) were imposed. Forage yield (FY), plant density (Src) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) were measured. The highest total average forage yield was 27.5 and 24.6 t DM ha−1 for all evaluated irrigation treatments and red clover materials, respectively. The highest average value of plant population was above 30 plants m−2 at the end of the second season. IWUE was close to 2.6 kg DM m−3 during the periods of maximum atmospheric demand (from January to March) for both growing seasons. A reduction of 20% of the applied irrigation could be a viable alternative for saving water in southern Chile without significantly reducing forage yield.},

This paper compares the adaptive capacity of two Canadian provinces, the province of Mendoza, Argentina and the administrative region of Coquimbo, Chile in relation to the vulnerability of farmers to droughts and floods by applying the adaptive capacity wheel (ACW). It concludes that Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada are particularly weak in terms of double- and triple-loop learning and in developing adaptive capacity in an equitable manner, probably attributable to strong climate scepticism in society and the weak economy. In the developing countries of Chile and Argentina, resources to assist with adaptation are often lacking; in Coquimbo, future learning is precarious because of information deficits in relation to data, memory, trust, and responsiveness; in Mendoza, institutions lack variety (redundancy of programs), resources, and governance processes are inadequately responsive. The paper makes contributions at the regional level by recommending that specific institutional weaknesses and lack of responsiveness be remedied by adopting appropriate missing instruments (perhaps, for example, water transfer provisions in Mendoza). New findings are made in relation to the dimensions of fair governance and learning capacity in the ACW. While learning capacity was closely linked to the dimension of leadership, the deficit of equity was closely linked to other indicators of fair governance (legitimacy, responsiveness, and accountability).},

The irrigation treatments were T0 = control (received 100% of the fruit grower irrigation); T1, T2, and T3 received 50%, 75% and 140% of T0. For both growing seasons, T0 and T3 averaged a midday stem water potential (Ψs) of −1.02 MPa, while that of T1 and T2 was at −1.13 MPa. Irrigation strategies applied affecting tree yield, fruit firmness (FF) at harvest, and WP. T3 and T2 had the highest and lowest yield. The best WP was found in T1. Growing season influenced fruit quality and quantity, and WP in the growing season 2014–2015. The irrigation treatment by growing season interaction was significant for FF. T2 and T3 exhibited the highest FF in the growing season 2013–2014. After cold storage, significant effects of the growing season were observed in fruit weight. Our results suggests that a moderate post-harvest water deficit (Ψs > −1.5 MPa), does not affect negatively, fruit quality and yield responses of cherry trees.},

This study compares Ψs and gs against crop water stress indexes (CWSI) calculated from thermal infrared (TIR) data from high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) cameras for two cherry tree cultivars: ‘Regina’ and ‘Sweetheart’. For this purpose, a water stress–recovery cycle experiment was carried out at the post-harvest period in a commercial drip-irrigated cherry tree orchard under three irrigation treatments based on Ψs levels. The water status of trees was measured weekly using Ψs, gs, and compared to CWSIs, computed from both thermal cameras. Results showed that the accuracy in the estimation of CWSIs was not statistically significant when comparing both cameras for the representation of Ψs and gs in both cultivars. The performance of all evaluated physiological indicators presented similar trends for both cultivars, and the averaged differences between CWSI’s from both cameras were 11 ± 0.27%. However, these CWSI’s were not able to detect differences among irrigation treatments as compared to Ψs and gs.},

            Growth is central to plant morphogenesis. Plant cells are encased in rigid cell walls, and they must overcome physical confinement to grow to specific sizes and shapes. Cell wall tension and turgor pressure are the main mechanical components impacting plant cell growth. Cell wall mechanics has been the focus of most plant biomechanical studies, and turgor pressure was often considered as a constant and largely passive component. Nevertheless, it is increasingly accepted that turgor pressure plays a significant role in plant growth. Numerous theoretical and experimental studies suggest that turgor pressure can be both spatially inhomogeneous and actively modulated during morphogenesis. Here, we revisit the pressure–growth relationship by reviewing recent advances in investigating the interactions between cellular/tissular pressure and growth.},

Remote sensing technology offers a promising alternative to traditional in situ measurements for estimating stem water potential (Ψstem).

Water status data were acquired at midday from 24 olive trees between June and October in both years. Reflectance data collected at the time of Ψstem measurements were utilized to calculate vegetation indices (VIs). Employing machine learning techniques, various prediction models were developed by considering VIs and spectral bands as predictors. Before the analyses, both datasets were randomly split into training and testing datasets. Our findings reveal that the random forest model outperformed other models, providing a more accurate prediction of olive water status (R2 = 0.78). This is the first study in the literature integrating remote sensing and machine learning techniques for the prediction of olive water status in order to improve olive orchard irrigation management, offering a practical solution for estimating Ψstem avoiding time-consuming and resource-intensive fieldwork.},

              Almonds are a major crop in California which produces 80\% of all the world’s almonds. Widespread drought and strict groundwater regulations pose significant challenges to growers. Irrigation regimes based on observed crop water status can help to optimize water use efficiency, but consistent and accurate measurement of water status can prove challenging. In almonds, crop water status is best represented by midday stem water potential measured using a pressure chamber, which despite its accuracy is impractical for growers to measure on a regular basis. This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) models to predict stem water potential in an almond orchard based on canopy spectral reflectance, soil moisture, and daily evapotranspiration. Both artificial neural network and random forest models were trained and used to produce high-resolution spatial maps of stem water potential covering the entire orchard. Also, for each ML model type, one model was trained to predict raw stem water potential values, while another was trained to predict baseline-adjusted values. Together, all models resulted in an average coefficient of correlation of R
              2
               = 0.73 and an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.5 bars. Prediction accuracy decreased significantly when models were expanded to spatial maps (R
              2
               = 0.33, RMSE = 3.31 [avg]). These results indicate that both artificial neural networks and random forest frameworks can be used to predict stem water potential, but both approaches were unable to fully account for the spatial variability observed throughout the orchard. Overall, the most accurate maps were produced by the random forest model (raw stem water potential R
              2
               = 0.47, RMSE = 2.71). The ability to predict stem water potential spatially can aid in the implementation of variable rate irrigation. Future studies should attempt to train similar models with larger datasets and develop a simpler faster workflow for producing stress predictions from field measurements.},

Although data from optical/multispectral sensors, as those of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, and data from SAR on board of Sentinel-1,  are very different,  their combination provides useful and interesting results. The integration and combination of these data can find useful application in many fields from oceans to waterways, from land surfaces to fossil deposits, from vegetation to forest areas. In this works authors have focused their interest in green areas and vegetation monitoring applications, by choosing as case of interest the Royal Palace of Caserta and its gardens.  The idea has started from the increasing interest in monitoring  the cultural heritage monuments and in particular  the surrounding vegetation with the green areas and the parks inside. Satellite images can put into evidence boundaries modifications, the vegetation state, their possible degradation, and other phenomena such as changes in the territories due both to natural and to anthropogenic causes. Data combination from different sources as above specified gives a good number of indexes very useful to analyze the vegetation state and its health in a very deep way. Many of these indexes have been calculated and discussed for investigation.{\textless}/span{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

              We present new global maps of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification at an unprecedented 1-km resolution for the present-day (1980–2016) and for projected future conditions (2071–2100) under climate change. The present-day map is derived from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps. The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients. We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species and vegetation distribution modeling.

            The concept of iso‐ vs. anisohydry has been used to describe the stringency of stomatal regulation of plant water potential (ψ). However, metrics that accurately and consistently quantify species’ operating ranges along a continuum of iso‐ to anisohydry have been elusive. Additionally, most approaches to quantifying iso/anisohydry require labour‐intensive measurements during prolonged drought. We evaluated new and previously developed metrics of stringency of stomatal regulation of ψ during soil drying in eight woody species and determined whether easily‐determined leaf pressure–volume traits could serve as proxies for their degree of iso‐ vs. anisohydry. Two metrics of stringency of stomatal control of ψ, (1) a ‘hydroscape’ incorporating the landscape of ψ over which stomata control ψ, and (2) the slope of the daily range of ψ as pre‐dawn ψ declined, were strongly correlated with each other and with the leaf osmotic potential at full and zero turgor derived from pressure–volume curves.},
